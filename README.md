# 2479Clothing_landing_page
Creating the landing page design for 2479Clothing. A friend of mine has recently set up a Shopify website, at https://2479clothing.co.uk/. As a challenge I wanted to see
if I could replicate it by using HTML, CSS & BS5. If you go the link above it will take you to the Shopify website, and if you check the 
document called 2479_home you can see my replica, and 2479_home_real for the website at the current date of 23/05/2022(the code is entirely different), p.s I know my code isn't perfect but I am trying to fix that day by day!
